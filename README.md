# pythonDocx
The goal of this project is to create a Python3 script, utilizing the python-docx package, that 
generates one or more Word documents from an input Word file and an input Excel file whose 
filepaths (directory path and filename) are hard-coded into the Python script. Example Word and 
Excel files are provided with this description. The Word file is an ordinary Word document that 
contains “paragraphs” and “tables” (these terms have a detailed meaning within the internal format 
of a Word document so see a more detailed discussion of paragraphs and tables below) that further 
include “tags” whose format and function are defined in this document.
